This is a starter project to use in an F# coding assignment working with event-sourcing and modeling a workflow.

It relies on .NET core and references Expecto as a testing library/runner.

Just clone the repo or download it, and get started coding and testing in F#!

To get started, just dotnet run in the folder to run the Expecto tests.
